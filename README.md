# Khurram Ali's Full Stack MERN Todo App Project

This is a solution to the [Khurram Ali's Full Stack MERN Todo App Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=giXuiotopO0). I'm testing my hand creating very simple (follow along) projects for now to get familiar with the matter.

## Overview

### The Challenge/User Stories

In this comprehensive tutorial, I'll guide you through the process of building a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) Todo application from scratch. You'll learn how to create a responsive design and set up a REST API for managing your tasks. We'll cover every step from development to deployment, and you'll have access to all the essential resources.

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework (No)
- Tailwind CSS
- Typescript (No)
- Nodejs
- Expressjs
- MongoDB

### What I learned

- Developed this React client application, constructing the frontend and incorporating it into the backend as a static file after building it using 'npm run build.' To ensure seamless communication, I employed a proxy in the package.json file and utilized relative paths for endpoint calls from the frontend.

- An alternative way of crafting this project would have been to making sure the backend and frontend are stored in separate repositories. In such a case I would further implement Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) policies to facilitate communication between them.

- This experience has equipped me with the skills to efficiently refactor a previous project, addressing incomplete deployments and enhancing overall deployment processes.

### Continued development

- More increasingly complex MERN stack projects.
